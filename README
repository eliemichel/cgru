Ongoing work
------------

Deliveryless system:
	The server does not initiate connections towards renders and monitors any
	more. It sends messages only as answers to clients heartbeat.

SocketPool:
	Server tries to keep connections alive as much as possible, managing them
	in a so called SocketPool object.

Logger:
	Logging system is being cleaned up. A unified style is applied in order to
	be easily read and/or parsed. Some potential features are on-the-fly
	verbosity switch, hierarchical log (indentation to see nested calls).
